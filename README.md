# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
In this project, we explore varying Kickstarter campaigns with their varying data to help Louise experience a successful campaign for her play, Fever. Below you will find more information of what this project entailed and a deeper dive into its results and conclusions.

### Purpose
Louise is an up and coming playwriter and has turned to our expertise in Excel to ensure a successful crowdfunding campaign. She forecasts that her play will have a budget larger than $10,000.00 and is evidently hesitant to jump into her first crowdfunding campaign. With the use of Pivot Tables, Charts, and other excel skills, we will assist her in finding specific factors to help her project become successful.
